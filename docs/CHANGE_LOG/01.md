A hot fix is scheduled for the BCGov Redhat SSO instance in the __dev, test, and prod__ environments later this evening. There are remediatory actions being taken 
to prevent the service degredation issues that have recently been affecting the service.

## More Information
- Approximate Time of Change: Dec 01 2020 8PM PST

- Service Bulletin No: n/a
- Impact Notes:
  - we will be rolling changes through environments in order (dev, test, prod) and only rolling through to the next environment on verification of succesful rollout of the previous one
  - the expected service downtime for each environment is __minimal__. We exepct a service downtime in each environment to be ~10 minutes.
